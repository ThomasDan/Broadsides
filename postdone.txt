Broadsides post-completion ideas:

1. "Smart" Shooting AI.
-Stop shooting random if it makes a hit, until it has sunk
	the ship.

The AI:
Hit a ship at 3,3 thanks to random.
-Coords recorded.
-Ship sunk false.
-streak++

AI will shoot UP, Right, Down then left.

AI found more ship at 3,2.
-Coords recorded.
-Ship sunk false.
-streak++

AI goes Left, hits no more ship at 3,1.

AI has already tried hitting 3,1, and so will
instead try shooting at 3,4 (3,2+streak)








2. Arrow-navigatable board when placing shots and boats.

3. Sac Bonus task:
	Allow other parts of the code to subscribe to
	an "OnSinking" event that is thrown by the ship.
